GPUImage-Only-iOS7-Blur
=======================

This project contains all of the files from Brad Larson's GPUImage framework that are required to utilize the framework's GPUImageiOSBlurFilter and then display that blurred content on screen with a GPUImageView. If you plan on using other features from GPUImage I recommend that you download the entire framework. I'm only suggesting this option if you only plan on using the one feature and don't want to bundle all 300ish files in your project.

I've included a copy of all these files within the repo, and will be listing all of these files below, but you should be sure to download up to date copies directly from the GPUImage repo located here https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage.
